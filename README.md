This repository contains code associated to the constraint optimization based group formation approach proposed in the following paper:
Amarasinghe, I., Hernández-Leo, D., & Jonsson, A. (2017). Intelligent group formation in computer supported collaborative learning scripts. In M. Chang, N. Chen, R. Huang, Kinshuk, D. G. Sampson, & R. Vasiu (Eds.), Proceedings of the 17th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT 2017) (pp. 201–203). IEEE. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALT.2017.62

We used Gurobi Optimizer (https://www.gurobi.com) a state-of-the-art solver for mathematical programming to solve the optimization problem and Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) microframework to implement group formation service.
